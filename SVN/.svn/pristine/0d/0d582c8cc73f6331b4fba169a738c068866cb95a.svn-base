== Description ==
This plugin allows an administrator to change the "site admin email", without sending a confirmation email from the server. This can be useful for testing purposes, localhost setups, or any other situation where outbound email is disabled. A new "feature" of WordPress 4.9 is that the administrator cannot change the site admin email without outgoing email setup on the server. This plugin restores the administrator's ability to change this setting without sending a confirmation email. Note that the "site admin email" is the global email used for admin purposes on the site. It is the "from" address when the site sends an email. The "site admin email" may be different from the administrator's personal user email, which is associated with the administrator's user account.

## Usage
Once activated, an administrator can change the admin email from the Settings >> General page.

== Installation ==
Clone or copy the file into your plugins directory, then activate the plugin from the admin menu. No other settings required.
