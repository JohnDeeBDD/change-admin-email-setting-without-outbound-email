A new "feature" of WordPress 4.9 is that the administrator cannot change the site admin email without outgoing email setup on the server, and recipient email credentials. Therefore, the admin cannot change the site email address unless outbound email is enabled. Although the admin still can run arbitrary code. This plugin restores the admin\'s ability to change this setting without sending a confirmation email.

== Description ==
This plugin restores the functionality as it was before version 4.9 on single sites. This may be required on sites without email access, or for testing purposes, i.e. on localhost. 

## Usage
Once activated, you do not need to do anything. You can change the admin email without outbound email traffic.
