This plugin allows an admin to change the site admin email setting - without sending an outbound confirmation email.

== Description ==
This plugin restores the functionality as it was before version 4.9. This may be required on sites without email access, or for testing purposes. i.e. on localhost.

## Usage
Once activated, you can change the admin email by going to "Settings" >> "General".

== Installation ==
Clone or copy the file into your plugins directory, then activate the plugin from the admin menu. No other settings required.
